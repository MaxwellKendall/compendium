  We believe in one God[a], the Father Almighty[b], Maker of heaven and
  earth[c], and of all things visible and invisible[d].

  And in one Lord Jesus Christ[e], the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the
  Father before all worlds[f]; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God;
  begotten, not made[g], being of one substance with the Father[h], by whom all
  things were made[i].

  Who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven[j], and was
  incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man[k]; and was
  crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate[l]; He suffered and was buried; and
  the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures[m]; and ascended into
  heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father[n]; and He shall come again,
  with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no
  end.[o]

  And we believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life[p]; who proceeds
  from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is
  worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets[q].

  And we believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.[r] We acknowledge
  one baptism for the remission of sins[s]; and we look for the resurrection of
  the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.[t]
