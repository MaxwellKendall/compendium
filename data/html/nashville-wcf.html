        Article 1 WE AFFIRM that God has designed marriage to be a covenantal,
        sexual, procreative, lifelong union of one man and one woman, as husband
        and wife, and is meant to signify the covenant love between Christ and
        his bride the church. WE DENY that God has designed marriage to be a
        homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship. We also deny that
        marriage is a mere human contract rather than a covenant made before
        God.

        <strong>WCF XXIV.I</strong> Marriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is
        it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to
        have more than one husband at the same time.

    </p>

    <p>

        <strong>WCF XXIV.II</strong> Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of
        husband and wife; for the increase of mankind with a
        legitimate issue, and of the Church with an holy seed; and for
        preventing of uncleanness.

      <strong>WLC Q. 20</strong>. What was the providence of God toward man in the estate in
        which he was created?  A. The providence of God toward man in the estate
        in which he was created, was the placing him in paradise, appointing him
        to dress it, giving him liberty to eat of the fruit of the earth;
        putting the creatures under his dominion, and <i>ordaining marriage for his
        help</i>; affording him communion with Himself; instituting the Sabbath;
        entering into a covenant of life with him, upon condition of personal,
        perfect, and perpetual obedience, of which the tree of life was a
        pledge; and forbidding to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
        upon the pain of death.

      Article 2 WE AFFIRM that God’s revealed will for all people is chastity
      outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage. WE DENY that any
      affections, desires, or commitments ever justify sexual intercourse before
      or outside marriage; nor do they justify any form of sexual immorality.

        shunning all occasions of uncleanness, and resisting temptations
        thereunto.  </p>

      Article 3 WE AFFIRM that God created Adam and Eve, the first human beings, in his own
      image, equal before God as persons, and distinct as male and female. WE DENY that the
      divinely ordained differences between male and female render them unequal in dignity or
      worth.

      They are acknowledged by our Lord Jesus in his words about “eunuchs who were born that
      way from their mother's womb.” With all others they are welcome as faithful followers of
      Jesus Christ and should embrace their biological sex insofar as it may be known. WE DENY

    believer who feels drawn into sexual sin.

    transgender selfconceptions and by divine forbearance to accept the God-ordained link

    the grace of God in Christ sanctions self-conceptions that are at odds with God’s revealed

      <strong>WCF XIII.I</strong> They who are effectually called and regenerated,
    having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, are
    further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of
    Christ’s death and resurrection, by his Word and Spirit
    dwelling in them; the dominion of the whole body of sin is
    destroyed, and the several lusts thereof are more and more
    weakened and mortified, and they more and more quickened
    and strengthened, in all saving graces, to the practice of true
    holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.

    <p>
      <strong>WCF XIII.II</strong> This sanctification is throughout in the whole man,
    yet imperfect in this life; there abideth still some remnants of
    corruption in every part, whence ariseth a continual and
    irreconcilable war, the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the
    spirit against the flesh.

      <strong>WCF XIII.III</strong> In which war, although the remaining corruption
    for a time may much prevail, yet, through the continual supply

    grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

    promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life his
    Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe.
