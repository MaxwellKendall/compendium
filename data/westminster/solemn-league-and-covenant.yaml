  We noblemen, barons, knights, gentlemen, citizens, burgesses, ministers of the
  Gospel, and commons of all sorts, in the kingdoms of Scotland, England, and
  Ireland, by the providence of GOD living under one king, and being of one
  reformed religion, having before our eyes the glory of God, and the advancement
  of the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, the honour and happiness of
  the king's majesty and his posterity, and the true public liberty, safety, and
  peace of the kingdom, wherein every one's private condition is included: and
  calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plots, conspiracies, attempts, and
  practices of the enemies of GOD, against the true religion and professors
  thereof in all places, especially in these three kingdoms, ever since the
  reformation of religion; and how much their rage, power, and presumption, are of
  late, and at this time, increased and exercised, whereof the deplorable state of
  the Church and kingdom of Ireland, the distressed state of the Church and
  kingdom of England, and the dangerous state of the Church and kingdom of
  Scotland, are present and public testimonies: we have now at last (after other
  means of supplication, remonstrance, protestation, and sufferings), for the
  preservation of ourselves and our religion from utter ruin and destruction,
  according to the commendable practice of these kingdoms in former times, and the
  example of GOD'S people in other nations, after mature deliberation, resolved
  and determined to enter into a Mutual and Solemn League and Covenant, wherein we
  all subscribe, and each one of us for himself, with our hands lifted up to the
  Most High GOD, do swear,

  I. THAT we shall sincerely, really, and constantly, through the grace of GOD,
  endeavor, in our several places and callings, the preservation of the reformed
  religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine, worship, discipline, and
  government, against our common enemies; the reformation of religion in the
  kingdoms of England and Ireland, in doctrine, worship, discipline, and
  government, according to the Word of GOD, and the example of the best reformed
  Churches; and shall endeavour to bring the Churches of GOD in the three
  kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion, Confession of
  Faith, Form of Church Government, Directory for Worship and Catechising; that
  we, and our posterity after us, may, as brethren, live in faith and love, and
  the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us.

  II. That we shall, in like manner, without respect of persons, endeavour the
  extirpation of Popery, Prelacy (that is, Church government by archbishops,
  bishops, their chancellors and commissioners, deans, deans and chapters,
  archdeacons, and all other ecclesiastical officers depending on that
  hierarchy), superstition, heresy, schism, profaneness, and whatsoever shall be
  found contrary to sound doctrine and the power of Godliness; lest we partake
  in other men's sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues; and
  that the Lord may be one, and his name one, in the three kingdoms.

  III. We shall, with the same sincerity, reality, and constancy, in our several
  vocations, endeavour, with our estates and lives, mutually to preserve the
  rights and privileges of the Parliaments, and the liberties of the kingdoms;
  and to preserve and defend the king's majesty's person and authority, in the
  preservation and defence of the true religion and liberties of the kingdoms;
  that the world may bear witness with our consciences of our loyalty, and that
  we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his majesty's just power and
  greatness.

  IV. We shall also, with all faithfulness, endeavour the discovery of all such
  as have been or shall be incendiaries, malignants, or evil instruments, be
  hindering the reformation of religion, dividing the king from his people, or
  one of the kingdoms from another, or making any faction or parties among the
  people, contrary to this League and Covenant; that they may be brought to
  public trial, and receive condign punishment, as the degree of their offences
  shall require or deserve, or the supreme judicatories of both kingdoms
  respectively, or others having power from them for that effect, shall judge
  convenient.

  V. And whereas the happiness of a blessed peace between these kingdoms, denied
  in former times to our progenitors, is, by the good providence of GOD, granted
  unto us, and hath been lately concluded and settled by both Parliaments; we
  shall, each one of us, according to our place and interest, endeavour that
  they may remain conjoined in a firm peace and union to all posterity; and that
  justice may be done upon the willful opposers thereof, in manner expressed in
  the precedent article.

  VI. We shall also, according to our places and callings, in this common cause
  of religion, liberty, and peace of the kingdoms, assist and defend all those
  that enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing
  thereof; and shall not suffer ourselves, directly or indirectly, by whatsoever
  combination, persuasion, or terror, to be divided or withdrawn from this
  blessed union and conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary part,
  or to give ourselves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this cause,
  which so much concerneth the glory of God, the good of the kingdom, and honour
  of the king; but shall, all the days of our lives, zealously and constantly
  continue therein against all opposition, and promote the same, according to
  our power, against all lets and impediments whatsoever; and what we are not
  able ourselves to suppress or overcome, we shall reveal and make known, that
  it may be timely prevented or removed: All which we shall do as in the sight
  of God.

  And, because these kingdoms are guilty of many sins and provocations against
  GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST, as is too manifest by our present distresses
  and dangers, the fruits thereof; we profess and declare, before GOD and the
  world, our unfeigned desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins
  of these kingdoms; especially that we have not, as we ought, valued the
  inestimable benefit of the Gospel; that we have not laboured for the purity
  and power thereof; and the we have not endeavoured to receive Christ in our
  hearts, not to walk worthy of him in our lives; which are the causes of other
  sins and transgression so much abounding amongst us: and our true and
  unfeigned purpose, desire, and endeavour, for ourselves, and all others under
  our power and charge, both in public and in private, in all duties we owe to
  GOD and man, to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the
  example of a real reformation; that the Lord may turn away his wrath and heavy
  indignation, and establish these Churches and kingdoms in truth and peace. And
  this Covenant we make in the presence of ALMIGHTY GOD, the Searcher of all
  hearts, with a true intention to perform the same, as we shall answer at that
  great day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed; most humbly
  beseeching the LORD to strengthen us by his HOLY SPIRIT for this end, and to
  bless our desires and proceedings with such success, as may be deliverance and
  safety to his people, and encouragement to other Christian Churches, groaning
  under, or in danger of the yoke of antichristian tyranny, to join in the same
  or like association and covenant, to the glory of GOD, the enlargement of the
  kingdom of JESUS CHRIST, and the peace and tranquillity of Christian kingdoms
  and commonwealths.
