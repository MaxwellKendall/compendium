Next, Reading of\nthe scriptures, with catechising in a plain way, that the understandings\nof the simpler may be the better enabled to profit under the publick\nordinances, and they made more capable to understand the scriptures when\nthey are read; together with godly conferences tending to the\nedification of all the members in the most holy faith: as also,\nadmonition and rebuke, upon just reasons, from those who have authority\nin the family.\n"},{"name":"III.","text":"\nAs the charge and office of interpreting the holy scriptures is a part\nof the ministerial calling, which none (however otherwise qualified)\nshould take upon him in any place, but he that is duly called thereunto\nby God and his kirk; so in every family where there is any that can\nread, the holy scriptures should be read ordinarily to the family; and\nit is commendable, that thereafter they confer, and by way of conference\nmake some good use of what hath been read and heard. As, for example, if\nany sin be reproved in the word read, use may be made thereof to make\nall the family circumspect and watchful against the same; or if any\njudgment be threatened, or mentioned to have been inflicted, in that\nportion of scripture which is read, use may be made to make all the\nfamily fear lest the same or a worse judgment befall them, unless they\nbeware of the sin that procured it: and, finally, if any duty be\nrequired, or comfort held forth in a promise, use may be made to stir up\nthemselves to employ Christ for strength to enable them for doing the\ncommanded duty, and to apply the offered comfort. In all which the\nmaster of the family is to have the chief hand; and any member of the\nfamily may propone a question or doubt for resolution.\n"},{"name":"IV.","text":"\nThe head of the family is to take care that none of the family withdraw\nhimself from any part of family-worship: and, seeing the ordinary\nperformance of all the parts of family-worship belongeth properly to the\nhead of the family, the minister is to stir up such as are lazy, and\ntrain up such as are weak, to a fitness to these exercises; it being\nalways free to persons of quality to entertain one approved by the\npresbytery for performing family-exercise. And in other families, where\nthe head of the family is unfit, that another, constantly residing in\nthe family, approved by the minister and session, may be employed in\nthat service, wherein the minister and session are to be countable to\nthe presbytery. And if a minister, by divine Providence, be brought to\nany family, it is requisite that at no time he convene a part of the\nfamily for worship, secluding the rest, except in singular cases\nespecially concerning these parties, which (in Christian prudence) need\nnot, or ought not, to be imparted to others.\n"},{"name":"V.","text":"\nLet no idler, who hath no particular calling, or vagrant person under\npretence of a calling, be suffered to perform worship in families, to or\nfor the same; seeing persons tainted with errors, or aiming at division,\nmay be ready (after that manner) to creep into houses, and lead captive\nsilly and unstable souls.\n"},{"name":"VI.","text":"\nAt family-worship, a special care is to be had that each family keep by\nthemselves; neither requiring, inviting, nor admitting persons from\ndivers families, unless it be those who are lodged with them, or at\nmeals, or otherwise with them upon some lawful occasion.\n"},{"name":"VII.","text":"\nWhatsoever have been the effects and fruits of meetings of persons of\ndivers families in the times of corruption or trouble, (in which cases\nmany things are commendable, which otherwise are not tolerable,) yet,\nwhen God hath blessed us with peace and purity of the gospel, such\nmeetings of persons of divers families (except in cases mentioned in\nthese Directions) are to be disapproved, as tending to the hinderance of\nthe religious exercise of each family by itself, to the prejudice of the\npublick ministry, to the rending of the families of particular\ncongregations, and (in progress of time) of the whole kirk. Besides many\noffences which may come thereby, to the hardening of the hearts of\ncarnal men, and grief of the godly.\n"},{"name":"VIII.","text":"\nOn the Lord's day, after every one of the family apart, and the whole\nfamily together, have sought the Lord (in whose hands the preparation of\nmen's hearts are) to fit them for the publick worship, and to bless to\nthem the publick ordinances, the master of the family ought to take care\nthat all within his charge repair to the publick worship, that he and\nthey may join with the rest of the congregation: and the publick worship\nbeing finished, after prayer, he should take an account what they have\nheard; and thereafter, to spend the rest of the time which they may\nspare in catechising, and in spiritual conferences upon the word of God:\nor else (going apart) they ought to apply themselves to reading,\nmeditation, and secret prayer, that they may confirm and increase their\ncommunion with God: that so the profit which they found in the publick\nordinances may be cherished and promoved, and they more edified unto\neternal life.\n"},{"name":"IX.","text":"\nSo many as can conceive prayer, ought to make use of that gift of God;\nalbeit those who are rude and weaker may begin at a set form of prayer,\nbut so as they be not sluggish in stirring up in themselves (according\nto their daily necessities) the spirit of prayer, which is given to all\nthe children of God in some measure: to which effect, they ought to be\nmore fervent and frequent in secret prayer to God, for enabling of their\nhearts to conceive, and their tongues to express, convenient desires to\nGod for their family.

And, to this effect, persons of\neminency (and all elders of the kirk) not only ought to stir up\nthemselves and families to diligence herein, but also to concur\neffectually, that in all other families, where they have power and\ncharge, the said exercises be conscionably performed.\n"},{"name":"XI.","text":"\nBesides the ordinary duties in families, which are above mentioned,\nextraordinary duties, both of humiliation and thanksgiving, are to be\ncarefully performed in families, when the Lord, by extraordinary\noccasions, (private or publick,) calleth for them.\n"},{"name":"XII.","text":"\nSeeing the word of God requireth that we should consider one another, to\nprovoke unto love and good works; therefore, at all times, and specially\nin this time, wherein profanity abounds, and mockers, walking after\ntheir own lusts, think it strange that others run not with them to the\nsame excess of riot; every member of this kirk ought to stir up\nthemselves, and one another, to the duties of mutual edification, by\ninstruction, admonition, rebuke; exhorting one another to manifest the\ngrace of God in denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and in living\ngodly, soberly and righteously in this present world; by comforting the\nfeeble-minded, and praying with or for one another. Which duties\nrespectively are to be performed upon special occasions offered by\nDivine Providence; as, namely, when under any calamity, cross, or great\ndifficulty, counsel or comfort is sought; or when an offender is to be\nreclaimed by private admonition, and if that be not effectual, by\njoining one or two more in the admonition, according to the rule of\nChrist, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be\nestablished.\n"},{"name":"XIII.","text":"\nAnd, because it is not given to every one to speak a word in season to a\nwearied or distressed conscience, it is expedient, that a person (in\nthat case,) finding no ease, after the use of all ordinary means,\nprivate and publick, have their address to their own pastor, or some\nexperienced Christian: but if the person troubled in conscience be of\nthat condition, or of that sex, that discretion, modesty, or fear of\nscandal, requireth a godly, grave, and secret friend to be present with\nthem in their said address, it is expedient that such a friend be\npresent.\n"},{"name":"XIV.","text":"\nWhen persons of divers families are brought together by Divine\nProvidence, being abroad upon their particular vocations, or any\nnecessary occasions; as they would have the Lord their God with them\nwhithersoever they go, they ought to walk with God, and not neglect the\nduties of prayer and thanksgiving, but take care that the same be\nperformed by such as the company shall judge fittest.
