He that is to be ordained, being either nominated by the people, or\notherwise commended to the presbytery, for any place, must address himself\nto the presbytery, and bring with him a testimonial of his taking the\ncovenant of the three kingdoms; of his diligence and proficiency in his\nstudies; what degrees he hath taken in the university, and what hath been\nthe time of his abode there; and withal of his age, which is to be twenty\nfour years; but especially of his life and conversation.\n\n2. Which being considered by the presbytery, they are to proceed to\nenquire touching the grace of God in him, and whether he be of such\nholiness of life as is requisite in a minister of the gospel; and to\nexamine him touching his learning and sufficiency, and touching the\nevidences of his calling to the holy ministry; and, in particular, his\nfair and direct calling to that place.\n\n#### The Rules for Examination are these:\n\n(1.) That the party examined be dealt withal in a brotherly way, with\nmildness of spirit, and with special respect to the gravity, modesty, and\nquality of every one.\n\n(2.) He shall be examined touching his skill in the original tongues, and\nhis trial to be made by reading the Hebrew and Greek Testaments, and\nrendering some portion of some into Latin; and if he be defective in them,\nenquiry shall be made more strictly after his other learning, and whether\nhe hath skill in logick and philosophy.\n\n(3.) What authors in divinity he hath read, and is best acquainted with;\nand trial shall be made in his knowledge of the grounds of religion, and\nof his ability to defend the orthodox doctrine contained in them against\nall unsound and erroneous opinions, especially these of the present age;\nof his skill in the sense and meaning of such places of scripture as shall\nbe proposed unto him, in cases of conscience, and in the chronology of the\nscripture, and the ecclesiastical history.\n\n(4.) If he hath not before preached in publick with approbation of such as\nare able to judge, he shall, at a competent time assigned him, expound\nbefore the presbytery such a place of scripture as shall be given him.\n\n(5.) He shall also, within a competent time, frame a discourse in Latin\nupon such a common-place or controversy in divinity as shall be assigned\nto him, and exhibit to the presbytery such theses as express the sum\nthereof, and maintain a dispute upon them.\n\n(6.) He shall preach before the people, the presbytery, or some of the\nministers of the word appointed by them, being present.\n\n(7.) The proportion of his gifts in relation to the place unto which he is\ncalled shall be considered.\n\n(8.) Beside the trial of his gifts in preaching, he shall undergo an\nexamination in the premises two several days, and more, if the presbytery\nshall judge it necessary.\n\n(9.) And as for him that hath formerly been ordained a minister, and is to\nbe removed to another charge, he shall bring a testimonial of his\nordination, and of his abilities and conversation, whereupon his fitness\nfor that place shall be tried by his preaching there, and (if it shall be\njudged necessary) by a further examination of him.\n\n3. In all which he being approved, he is to be sent to the church where he\nis to serve, there to preach three several days and to converse with the\npeople, that they may have trial of his gifts for their edification, and\nmay have time and occasion to enquire into, and the better to know, his\nlife and conversation.\n\n4. In the last of these three days appointed for the trial of his gifts in\npreaching, there shall be sent from the presbytery to the congregation a\npublick intimation in writing, which shall be publickly read before the\npeople, and after affixed to the church-door, to signify that such a day a\ncompetent number of the members of that congregation, nominated by\nthemselves, shall appear before the presbytery, to give their consent and\napprobation to such a man to be their minister; or otherwise, to put in,\nwith all Christian discretion and meekness, what exceptions they have\nagainst him. And if, upon the day appointed, there be no just exception\nagainst him, but the people give their consent, then the presbytery shall\nproceed to ordination.\n\n5. Upon the day appointed for ordination, which is to be performed in that\nchurch where he that is to be ordained is to serve, a solemn fast shall be\nkept by the congregation, that they may the more earnestly join in prayer\nfor a blessing upon the ordinances of Christ, and the labours of his\nservant for their good. The presbytery shall come to the place, or at\nleast three or four ministers of the word shall be sent thither from the\npresbytery; of which one appointed by the presbytery shall preach to the\npeople concerning the office and duty of ministers of Christ, and how the\npeople ought to receive them for their work's sake.\n\n6. After the sermon, the minister who hath preached shall, in the face of\nthe congregation, demand of him who is now to be ordained, concerning how\nfaith in Christ Jesus, and his persuasion of the truth of the reformed\nreligion, according to the scriptures; his sincere intentions and ends in\ndesiring to enter into this calling; his diligence in praying, reading,\nmeditation, preaching, ministering the sacraments, discipline, and doing\nall ministerial duties towards his charge; his zeal and faithfulness in\nmaintaining the truth of the gospel, and unity of the church, against\nerror and schism; his care that himself and his family may be unblameable,\nand examples to the flock; his willingness and humility, in meekness of\nspirit, to submit unto the admonitions of his brethren, and discipline of\nthe church; and his resolution to continue in his duty against all trouble\nand persecution.\n\n7. In all which having declared himself, professed his willingness, and\npromised his endeavours, by the help of God; the minister likewise shall\ndemand of the people concerning their willingness to receive and\nacknowledge him as the minister of Christ; and to obey and submit unto\nhim, as having rule over them in the Lord; and to maintain, encourage, and\nassist him in all the parts of his office.\n\n8. Which being mutually promised by the people, the presbytery, or the\nministers sent from them for ordination, shall solemnly set him apart to\nthe office and work of the ministry, by laying their hands on him, which\nis to be accompanied with a short prayer or blessing, to this effect:\n\n\"Thankfully acknowledging the great mercy of God in sending Jesus\nChrist for the redemption of his people; and for his ascension to the\nright hand of God the Father, and thence pouring out his Spirit, and\ngiving gifts to men, apostles, evangelists, prophets, pastors, and\nteachers; for the gathering and building up of his church; and for fitting\nand inclining this man to this great work: to entreat him to fit him with\nhis Holy Spirit, to give him (who in his name we thus set apart to this\nholy service) to fulfil the work of his ministry in all things, that he\nmay both save himself, and his people committed to his charge.\"\n\n9. This or the like form of prayer and blessing being ended, let the\nminister who preached briefly exhort him to consider of the greatness of\nhis office and work, the danger of negligence both to himself and his\npeople, the blessing which will accompany his faithfulness in this life,\nand that to come; and withal exhort the people to carry themselves to him,\nas to their minister in the Lord, according to their solemn promise made\nbefore. And so by prayer commending both him and his flock to the grace of\nGod, after singing of a psalm, let the assembly be dismissed with a\nblessing.\n\n10. If a minister be designed to a congregation, who hath been formerly\nordained presbyter according to the form of ordination which hath been in\nthe church of England, which we hold for substance to be valid, and not to\nbe disclaimed by any who have received it; then, there being a cautious\nproceeding in matters of examination, let him be admitted without any new\nordination.\n\n11. And in case any person already ordained minister in Scotland, or in\nany other reformed church, be designed to another congregation in England,\nhe is to bring from that church to the presbytery here, within which that\ncongregation is, a sufficient testimonial of his ordination, of his life\nand conversation while he lived with them, and of the causes of his\nremoval; and to undergo such a trial of his fitness and sufficiency, and\nto have the same course held with him in other particulars, as is set down\nin the rule immediately going before, touching examination and admission.\n\n12. That records be carefully kept in the several presbyteries, of the\nnames of the persons ordained, with their testimonials, the time and place\nof their ordination, of the presbyters who did impose hands upon them, and\nof the charge to which they are appointed.\n\n13. That no money or gift, of what kind soever, shall be received from the\nperson to be ordained, or from any on his behalf, for ordination, or ought\nelse belonging to it, by any of the presbytery, or any appertaining to any\nof them, upon what pretence soever.\n"},{"name":"Thus far of ordinary Rules, and course of Ordination, in the ordinary way; that which concerns the extraordinary way, requisite to be now practised, followeth\n","text":"\n1. In these present exigencies, while we cannot have any presbyteries\nformed up to their whole power and work, and that many ministers are to be\nordained for the service of the armies and navy, and to many congregations\nwhere there is no minister at all; and where (by reason of the publick\ntroubles) the people cannot either themselves enquire and find out one who\nmay be a faithful minister for them, or have any with safety sent unto\nthem, for such a solemn trial as was before mentioned in the ordinary\nrules; especially, when there can be no presbytery near unto them, to whom\nthey may address themselves, or which may come or send to them a fit man\nto be ordained in that congregation, and for that people; and yet\nnotwithstanding, it is requisite that ministers be ordained for them by\nsome, who, being set apart themselves for the work of the ministry, have\npower to join in the setting apart others, who are found fit and worthy.\nIn those cases, until, by God's blessing, the aforesaid difficulties may\nbe in some good measure removed, let some godly ministers, in or about the\ncity of London, be designed by publick authority, who, being associated,\nmay ordain ministers for the city and the vicinity, keeping as near to the\nordinary rules fore-mentioned as possibly they may; and let this\nassociation be for no other intent or purpose, but only for the work of\nordination.\n\n2.
