{"name":"The Directory for Publick Worship","publication_year":1645,"type":"document","markdown":true,"chapters":[{"name":"The preface","text":"In the beginning of the blessed Reformation, our wise and pious ancestors\ntook care to set forth an order for redress of many things, which they\nthen, by the word, discovered to be vain erroneous, superstitious, and\nidolatrous, in the publick worship of God. This occasioned many godly and\nlearned men to rejoice much in the Book of Common Prayer, at that time set\nforth; because the mass, and the rest of the Latin service being removed,\nthe publick worship was celebrated in our own tongue: many of the common\npeople also receive benefit by hearing the scriptures read in their own\nlanguage, which formerly were unto them as a book that is sealed.\n\nHowbeit, long and sad experience hath made it manifest, that the Liturgy\nused in the Church of England, (notwithstanding all the pains and\nreligious intentions of the Compilers of it,) hath proved an offence, not\nonly to many of the godly at home, but also to the reformed Churches\nabroad. For, not to speak of urging the reading of all the prayers, which\nvery greatly increased the burden of it, the many unprofitable and\n\nburdensome ceremonies contained in it have occasioned much mischief, as\nwell by disquieting the consciences of many godly ministers and people,\nwho could not yield unto them, as by depriving them of the ordinances of\nGod, which they might not enjoy without conforming or subscribing to those\nceremonies. Sundry good Christians have been, by means thereof, kept from\nthe Lord's table; and divers able and faithful ministers debarred from the\nexercise of their ministry, (to the endangering of many thousand souls, in\na time of such scarcity of faithful pastors,) and spoiled of their\nlivelihood, to the undoing of them and their families. Prelates, and their\nfaction, have laboured to raise the estimation of it to such a height, as\nif there were no other worship, or way of worship of God, amongst us, but\nonly the Service-book; to the great hinderance of the preaching of the\nword, and (in some places, especially of late) to the justling of it out\nas unnecessary, or at best, as far inferior to the reading of common\nprayer; which was made no better than an idol by many ignorant and\nsuperstitious people, who, pleasing themselves in their presence at that\nservice, and their lip-labour in bearing a part in it, have thereby\nhardened themselves in their ignorance and carelessness of saving\nknowledge and true piety.\n\nIn the meantime, Papists boasted that the book was a compliance with them\nin a great part of their service; and so were not a little confirmed in\ntheir superstition and idolatry, expecting rather our return to them, than\nendeavouring the reformation of themselves: in which expectation they were\nof late very much encouraged, when, upon the pretended warrantableness of\nimposing of the former ceremonies, new ones were daily obtruded upon the\nChurch.\n\nAdd hereunto, (which was not foreseen, but since have come to pass,) that\nthe Liturgy hath been a great means, as on the one hand to make and\nincrease an idle and unedifying ministry, which contented itself with set\nforms made to their hands by others, without putting forth themselves to\nexercise the gift of prayer, with which our Lord Jesus Christ pleaseth to\nfurnish all his servants whom he calls to that office: so, on the other\nside, it hath been (and ever would be, if continued) a matter of endless\nstrife and contention in the Church, and a snare both to many godly and\nfaithful ministers, who have been persecuted and silenced upon that\noccasion, and to others of hopeful parts, many of which have been, and\nmore still would be, diverted from all thoughts of the ministry to other\nstudies; especially in these latter times, wherein God vouchsafeth to his\npeople more and better means for the discovery of error and superstition,\nand for attaining of knowledge in the mysteries of godliness, and gifts in\npreaching and prayer.\n\nUpon these, and many the like weighty considerations in reference to the\nwhole book in general, and because of divers particulars contained in it;\nnot from any love to novelty, or intention to disparage our first\nreformers, (of whom we are persuaded, that, were they now alive, they\nwould join with us in this work, and whom we acknowledge as excellent\ninstruments, raised by God, to begin the purging and building of his\nhouse, and desire they may be had of us and posterity in everlasting\nremembrance, with thankfulness and honour,) but that we may in some\nmeasure answer the gracious providence of God, which at this time calleth\nupon us for further reformation, and may satisfy our own consciences, and\nanswer the expectation of other reformed churches, and the desires of many\nof the godly among ourselves, and withal give some publick testimony of\nour endeavours for uniformity in divine worship, which we have promised in\nour Solemn League and Covenant; we have, after earnest and frequent\ncalling upon the name of God, and after much consultation, not with flesh\nand blood, but with his holy word, resolved to lay aside the former\nLiturgy, with the many rites and ceremonies formerly used in the worship\nof God; and have agreed upon this following Directory for all the parts of\npublick worship, at ordinary and extraordinary times. Wherein our care\nhath been to hold forth such things as are of divine institution in every\nordinance; and other things we have endeavoured to set forth according to\nthe rules of Christian prudence, agreeable to the general rules of the\nword of God; our meaning therein being only, that the general heads, the\nsense and scope of the prayers, and other parts of publick worship, being\nknown to all, there may be a consent of all the churches in those things\nthat contain the substance of the service and worship of God; and the\nministers may be hereby directed, in their administrations, to keep like\nsoundness in doctrine and prayer, and may, if need be, have some help and\nfurniture, and yet so as they become not hereby slothful and negligent in\nstirring up the gifts of Christ in them; but that each one, by meditation,\nby taking heed to himself, and the flock of God committed to him, and by\nwise observing the ways of Divine Providence, may be careful to furnish\nhis heart and tongue with further or other materials of prayer and\nexhortation, as shall be needful upon all occasions.\n"},{"name":"Of the Assembling of the Congregation, and their Behaviour in the Publick Worship of God.","text":"\nWhen the congregation is to meet for publick worship, the people (having\nbefore prepared their hearts thereunto) ought all to come and join\ntherein; not absenting themselves from the publick ordinance through\nnegligence, or upon pretence of private meetings.\n\nLet all enter the assembly, not irreverently, but in a grave and seemly\nmanner, taking their seats or places without adoration, or bowing\nthemselves towards one place or other.\n\nThe congregation being assembled, the minister, after solemn calling on\nthem to the worshipping of the great name of God, is to begin with\nprayer.\n\n\"In all reverence and humility acknowledging the incomprehensible\ngreatness and majesty of the Lord, (in whose presence they do then in a\nspecial manner appear,) and their own vileness and unworthiness to\napproach so near him, with their utter inability of themselves to so\ngreat a work; and humbly beseeching him for pardon, assistance, and\nacceptance, in the whole service then to be performed; and for a blessing\non that particular portion of his word then to be read: And all in the\nname and mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n\nThe publick worship being begun, the people are wholly to attend upon it,\nforbearing to read any thing, except what the minister is then reading or\nciting; and abstaining much more from all private whisperings,\nconferences, salutations, or doing reverence to any person present, or\ncoming in; as also from all gazing, sleeping, and other indecent\nbehaviour, which may disturb the minister or people, or hinder themselves\nor others in the service of God.\n\nIf any, through necessity, be hindered from being present at the\nbeginning, they ought not, when they come into the congregation, to\nbetake themselves to their private devotions, but reverently to compose\nthemselves to join with the assembly in that ordinance of God which is\nthen in hand.\n"},{"name":"Of Publick Reading of the Holy Scriptures.","text":"\nReading of the word in the congregation, being part of the publick\nworship of God, (wherein .i.we; acknowledge our dependence upon him, and\nsubjection to him,) and one mean sanctified by him for the edifying of\nhis people, is to be performed by the pastors and teachers.\n\nHowbeit, such as intend the ministry, may occasionally both read the\nword, and exercise their gift in preaching in the congregation, if\nallowed by the presbytery thereunto.\n\nAll the canonical books of the Old and New Testament (but none of those\nwhich are commonly called *Apocrypha*) shall be publickly read in the\nvulgar tongue, out of the best allowed translation, distinctly, that all\nmay hear and understand.\n\nHow large a portion shall be read at once, is left to the wisdom of the\nminister; but it is convenient, that ordinarily one chapter of each\nTestament be read at every meeting; and sometimes more, where the\nchapters be short, or the coherence of matter requireth it.\n\nIt is requisite that all the canonical books be read over in order, that\nthe people may be better acquainted with the whole body of the\nscriptures; and ordinarily, where the reading in either Testament endeth\non one Lord's day, it is to begin the next.\n\nWe commend also the more frequent reading of such scriptures as he that\nreadeth shall think best for edification of his hearers, as the book of\nPsalms, and such like.\n\nWhen the minister who readeth shall judge it necessary to expound any\npart of what is read, let it not be done until the whole chapter or psalm\nbe ended; and regard is always to be had unto the time, that neither\npreaching, nor other ordinances be straitened, or rendered tedious. Which\nrule is to be observed in all other publick performances.\n\nBeside publick reading of the holy scriptures, every person that can\nread, is to be exhorted to read the scriptures privately, (and all others\nthat cannot read, if not disabled by age, or otherwise, are likewise to\nbe exhorted to learn to read,) and to have a Bible.\n"},{"name":"Of Publick Prayer before the Sermon.","text":"\nAfter reading of the word, (and singing of the psalm,) the minister who\nis to preach, is to endeavour to get his own and his hearers hearts to be\nrightly affected with their sins, that they, may all mourn in sense\nthereof before the Lord, and hunger and thirst after the grace of God in\nJesus Christ, by proceeding to a more full confession of sin, with shame\nand holy confusion of face, and to call upon the Lord to this effect:\n\n\"To acknowledge our great sinfulness, First, by reason of original sin,\nwhich (beside the guilt that makes us liable to everlasting damnation) is\nthe seed of all other sins, hath depraved and poisoned all the faculties\nand powers of soul and body, doth defile our best actions, and (were it\nnot restrained, or our hearts renewed by grace) would break forth into\ninnumerable transgressions, and greatest rebellions against the Lord that\never were committed by the vilest of the sons of men; and next, by reason\nof actual sins, our own sins, the sins of magistrates, of ministers, and\nof the whole nation, unto which we are many ways accessory: which sins of\nours receive many fearful aggravations, we having broken all the\ncommandments of the holy, just, and good law of God, doing that which is\nforbidden, and leaving undone what is enjoined; and that not only out of\nignorance and infirmity, but also more pre sumptuously, against the light\nof our minds, checks of our consciences, and motions of his own Holy\nSpirit to the contrary, so that we have no cloak for our sins; yea, not\nonly despising the riches of God's goodness, forbearance, and\nlong-suffering, but standing out against many invitations and offers of\ngrace in the gospel; not endeavouring, as we ought, to receive Christ\ninto our hearts by faith, or to walk worthy of him in our lives.\n\nTo bewail our blindness of mind, hardness of heart, unbelief,\nimpenitency, security, lukewarmness, barrenness; or not endeavouring\nafter mortification and newness of life, nor after the exercise of\ngodliness in the power thereof; and that the best of us have not so\nstedfastly walked with God, kept our garments so unspotted, nor been so\nzealous of his glory, and the good of others, as we ought: and to mourn\nover such other sins as the congregation is particularly guilty of,\nnotwithstanding the manifold and great mercies of our God, the love of\nChrist, the light of the gospel, and reformation of religion, our own\npurposes, promises, vows, solemn covenant, and other special obligations,\nto the contrary.\n\nTo acknowledge and confess, that, as we are convinced of our guilt, so,\nout of a deep sense thereof, we judge ourselves unworthy of the smallest\nbenefits, most worthy of God's fiercest wrath, and of all the curses of\nthe law, and heaviest judgments inflicted upon the most rebellious\nsinners; and that he might most justly take his kingdom and gospel from\nus, plague us with all sorts of spiritual and temporal judgments in this\nlife, and after cast us into utter darkness, in the lake that burneth\nwith fire and brimstone, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth for\nevermore.\n\nNotwithstanding all which, to draw near to the throne of grace,\nencouraging ourselves with hope of a gracious answer of our prayers, in\nthe riches and all-sufficiency of that only one oblation, the\nsatisfaction and intercession of the Lord Jesus Christ, at the right hand\nof his Father and our Father; and in confidence of the exceeding great\nand precious promises of mercy and grace in the new covenant, through the\nsame Mediator thereof, to deprecate the heavy wrath and curse of God,\nwhich we are not able to avoid, or bear;

seal unto us, by the same Spirit of adoption, the full\nassurance of our pardon and reconciliation; comfort all that mourn in\nZion, speak peace to the wounded and troubled spirit, and bind up the\nbroken-hearted: and as for secure and presumptuous sinners, that he would\nopen their eyes, convince their consciences, and turn them from darkness\nunto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they also may\nreceive forgiveness of sin, and an inheritance among them that are\nsanctified by faith in Christ Jesus.\n\nWith remission of sins through the blood of Christ, to pray for\nsanctification by his Spirit; the mortification of sin dwelling in and\nmany times tyrannizing over us; the quickening of our dead spirits with\nthe life of God in Christ; grace to fit and enable us for all duties of\nconversation and callings towards God and men; strength against\ntemptations; the sanctified use of blessings and crosses; and\nperseverance in faith and obedience unto the end.\n\nTo pray for the propagation of the gospel and kingdom of Christ to all\nnations; for the conversion of the Jews, the fulness of the Gentiles, the\nfall of Antichrist, and the hastening of the second coming of our Lord;\nfor the deliverance of the distressed churches abroad from the tyranny of\nthe antichristian faction, and from the cruel oppressions and blasphemies\nof the Turk; for the blessing of God upon the reformed churches,\nespecially upon the churches and kingdoms of Scotland, England, and\nIreland, now more strictly and religiously united in the Solemn National\nLeague and Covenant; and for our plantations in the remote parts of the\nworld: more particularly for that church and kingdom whereof we are\nmembers, that therein God would establish peace and truth , the purity of\nall his ordinances, and the power of godliness; prevent and remove\nheresy, schism, profaneness, superstition, security, and unfruitfulness\nunder the means of grace; heal all our rents and divisions, and preserve\nus from breach of our Solemn Covenant.\n\nTo pray for all in authority, especially for the King's Majesty; that God\nwould make him rich in blessings, both in his person and government;\nestablish his throne in religion and righteousness, save him from evil\ncounsel, and make him a blessed and glorious instrument for the\nconservation and propagation of the gospel, for the encouragement and\nprotection of them that do well, the terror of all that do evil, and the\ngreat good of the whole church, and of all his kingdoms; for the\nconversion of the Queen, the religious education of the Prince, and the\nrest of the royal seed; for the comforting of the afflicted Queen of\nBohemia, sister to our Sovereign; and for the restitution and\nestablishment of the illustrious Prince Charles, Elector Palatine of the\nRhine, to all his dominions and dignities; for a blessing upon the High\nCourt of Parliament, (when sitting in any of these kingdoms\nrespectively,) the nobility, the subordinate judges and magistrates, the\ngentry, and all the commonality; for all pastors and teachers, that God\nwould fill them with his Spirit, make them exemplarily holy, sober, just,\npeaceable, and gracious in their lives; sound, faithful, and powerful in\ntheir ministry; and follow all their labours with abundance of success\nand blessing; and give unto all his people pastors according to his own\nheart; for the universities, and all schools and religious seminaries of\nchurch and commonwealth, that they may flourish more and more in learning\nand piety; for the particular city or congregation, that God would pour\nout a blessing upon the ministry of the word, sacraments, and discipline,\nupon the civil government, and all the several families and persons\ntherein; for mercy to the afflicted under any inward or outward distress;\nfor seasonable weather, and fruitful seasons, as the time may require;\nfor averting the judgments that we either feel or fear, or are liable\nunto as famine, pestilence, the sword, and such like.\n\nAnd, with confidence of his mercy to his whole church, and the acceptance\nof our persons, through the merits and mediation of our High Priest, the\nLord Jesus, to profess that it is the desire of our souls to have\nfellowship with God in the reverend and conscionable use of his holy\nordinances; and, to that purpose, to pray earnestly for his grace and\neffectual assistance to the sanctification of his holy sabbath, the\nLord's day, in all the duties thereof, publick and private, both to\nourselves, and to all other congregations of his people, according to the\nriches and excellency of the gospel, this day celebrated and enjoyed.\n\nAnd because we have been unprofitable hearers in times past, and now\ncannot of ourselves receive, as we should, the deep things of God, the\nmysteries of Jesus Christ, which require a spiritual discerning; to pray,\nthat the Lord, who teacheth to profit, would graciously please to pour\nout the Spirit of grace, together with the outward means thereof, causing\nus to attain such a measure of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ\nJesus our Lord, and, in him, of the things which belong to our peace,\nthat we may account all things but as dross in comparison of him; and\nthat we, tasting the first-fruits of the glory that is to be revealed,\nmay long for a more full and perfect communion with him, that where he\nis, we may be also, and enjoy the fulness of those joys and pleasures\nwhich are at his right hand for evermore.\n\nMore particularly, that God would in a special manner furnish his servant\n(now called to dispense the bread of life unto his household) with\nwisdom, fidelity, zeal, and utterance, that he may divide the word of God\naright, to every one his portion, in evidence and demonstration of the\nSpirit and power; and that the Lord would circumcise the ears and hearts\nof the hearers, to hear, love, and receive with meekness the ingrafted\nword, which is able to save their souls; make them as good ground to\nreceive in the good seed of the word, and strengthen them against the\ntemptations of Satan, the cares of the world, the hardness of their own\nhearts, and whatsoever else may hinder their profitable and saving\nhearing; that so Christ may be so formed in them, and live in them, that\nall their thoughts may be brought into captivity to the obedience of\nChrist, and their hearts established in every good word and work for\never.\n\nWe judge this to be a convenient order, in the ordinary public prayer;\nyet so, as the minister may defer (as in prudence he shall think meet)\nsome part of these petitions till after his sermon, or offer up to God\nsome of the thanksgivings hereafter appointed, in his prayer before his\nsermon.\n"},{"name":"Of the Preaching of the Word","text":"\nPreaching of the word, being the power of God unto salvation, and one of\nthe greatest and most excellent works belonging to the ministry of the\ngospel, should be so performed, that the workman need not be ashamed, but\nmay save himself, and those that hear him.\n\nIt is presupposed, (according to the rules for ordination,) that the\nminister of Christ is in some good measure gifted for so weighty a\nservice, by his skill in the original languages, and in such arts and\nsciences as are handmaids unto divinity; by his knowledge in the whole\nbody of theology, but most of all in the holy scriptures, having his\nsenses and heart exercised in them above the common sort of believers;\nand by the illumination of God's Spirit, and other gifts of edification,\nwhich (together with reading and studying of the word) he ought still to\nseek by prayer, and an humble heart, resolving to admit and receive any\ntruth not yet attained, whenever God shall make it known unto him. All\nwhich he is to make use of, and improve, in his private preparations,\nbefore he deliver in public what he hath provided.\n\nOrdinarily, the subject of his sermon is to be some text of scripture,\nholding forth some principle or head of religion, or suitable to some\nspecial occasion emergent; or he may go on in some chapter, psalm, or\nbook of the holy scripture, as he shall see fit.\n\nLet the introduction to his text be brief and perspicuous, drawn from the\ntext itself, or context, or some parallel place, or general sentence of\nscripture.\n\nIf the text be long, (as in histories or parables it sometimes must be,)\nlet him give a brief sum of it; if short, a paraphrase thereof, if need\nbe: in both, looking diligently to the scope of the text, and pointing at\nthe chief heads and grounds of doctrine which he is to raise from it.\n\nIn analysing and dividing his text, he is to regard more the order of\nmatter than of words; and neither to burden the memory of the hearers in\nthe beginning with too many members of division, nor to trouble their\nminds with obscure terms of art.\n\nIn raising doctrines from the text, his care ought to be, *First,* That\nthe matter be the truth of God. *Secondly,* That it be a truth contained\nin or grounded on that text, that the hearers may discern how God\nteacheth it from thence. *Thirdly,* That he chiefly insist upon those\ndoctrines which are principally intended; and make most for the\nedification of the hearers.\n\nThe doctrine is to be expressed in plain terms; or, if any thing in it\nneed explication, it is to be opened, and the consequence also from the\ntext cleared. The parallel places of scripture, confirming the doctrine,\nare rather to be plain and pertinent, than many, and (it need be) some\nwhat insisted upon, and applied to the purpose in hand.\n\nThe arguments or reasons are to be solid, and, as much as may be,\nconvincing. The illustrations, of what kind soever, ought to be full of\nlight, and such as may convey the truth into the hearer's heart with\nspiritual delight.\n\nIf any doubt obvious from scripture, reason, or prejudice of the hearers,\nseem to arise, it is very requisite to remove it, by reconciling the\nseeming differences, answering the reasons, and discovering and taking\naway the causes of prejudice and mistake. Otherwise it is not fit to\ndetain the hearers with propounding or answering vain or wicked cavils,\nwhich, as they are endless, so the propounding and answering of them doth\nmore hinder than promote edification.\n\nHe is not to rest in general doctrine, although never so much cleared and\nconfirmed, but to bring it home to special use, by application to his\nhearers: which albeit it prove a work of great difficulty to himself,\nrequiring much prudence, zeal, and meditation, and to the natural and\ncorrupt man will be very unpleasant; yet he is to endeavour to perform it\nin such a manner, that his auditors may feel the word of God to be quick\nand powerful, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;\nand that, if any unbeliever or ignorant person be present, he may have\nthe secrets of his heart made manifest, and give glory to God.\n\nIn the use of instruction or information in the knowledge of some truth ,\nwhich is a consequence from his doctrine, he may (when convenient)\nconfirm it by a few firm arguments from the text in hand, and other\nplaces of scripture, or from the nature of that common-place in divinity,\nwhereof that truth is a branch.\n\nIn confutation of false doctrines, he is neither to raise an old heresy\nfrom the grave, nor to mention a blasphemous opinion unnecessarily: but,\nif the people be in danger of an error, he is to confute it soundly, and\nendeavour to satisfy their judgments and consciences against all\nobjections.\n\nIn exhorting to duties, he is, as he seeth cause, to teach also the means\nthat help to the performance of them.\n\nIn dehortation, reprehension, and publick admonition, (which require\nspecial wisdom,) let him, as there shall be cause, not only discover the\nnature and greatness of the sin, with the misery attending it, but also\nshew the danger his hearers are in to be overtaken and surprised by it,\ntogether with the remedies and best way to avoid it.\n\nIn applying comfort, whether general against all temptations, or\nparticular against some special troubles or terrors, he is carefully to\nanswer such objections as a troubled heart and afflicted spirit may\nsuggest to the contrary. It is also sometimes requisite to give some\nnotes of trial, (which is very profitable, especially when performed by\nable and experienced ministers, with circumspection and prudence, and the\nsigns clearly grounded on the holy scripture,) whereby the hearers may be\nable to examine themselves whether they have attained those graces, and\nperformed those duties, to which he exhorteth, or be guilty of the sin\nreprehended, and in danger of the judgments threatened, or are such to\nwhom the consolations propounded do belong; that accordingly they may be\nquickened and excited to duty, humbled for their wants and sins, affected\nwith their danger, and strengthened with comfort, as their condition,\nupon examination, shall require.\n\nAnd, as he needeth not always to prosecute every doctrine which lies in\nhis text, so is he wisely to make choice of such uses, as, by his\nresidence and conversing with his flock, he findeth most needful and\nseasonable; and, amongst these, such as may most draw their souls to\nChrist, the fountain of light, holiness, and comfort.\n\nThis method is not prescribed as necessary for every man, or upon every\ntext; but only recommended, as being found by experience to be very much\nblessed of God, and very helpful for the people's understandings and\nmemories.\n\nBut the servant of Christ, whatever his method be, is to perform his\nwhole ministry:\n\n1. Painfully, not doing the work of the Lord negligently.\n\n2. Plainly, that the meanest may understand; delivering the truth not in the\n   enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of\n   power, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect; abstaining\n   also from an unprofitable use of unknown tongues, strange phrases, and\n   cadences of sounds and words; sparingly citing sentences of ecclesiastical\n   or other human writers, ancient or modern, be they never so elegant.\n\n3. Faithfully, looking at the honour of Christ, the conversion, edification,\n   and salvation of the people, not at his own gain or glory; keeping nothing\n   back which may promote those holy ends, giving to every one his own portion,\n   and bearing indifferent respect unto all, without neglecting the meanest, or\n   sparing the greatest, in their sins.\n\n4. Wisely, framing all his doctrines, exhortations, and especially his\n   reproofs, in such a manner as may be most likely to prevail; shewing all due\n   respect to each man's person and place, and not mixing his own passion or\n   bitterness.\n\n5. Gravely, as becometh the word of God; shunning all such gesture, voice, and\n   expressions, as may occasion the corruptions of men to despise him and his\n   ministry.\n\n6. With loving affection, that the people may see all coming from his godly\n   zeal, and hearty desire to do them good. And,\n\n7. As taught of God, and persuaded in his own heart, that all that he teacheth\n   is the truth of Christ; and walking before his flock, as an example to them\n   in it; earnestly, both in private and publick, recommending his labours to\n   the blessing of God, and watchfully looking to himself, and the flock\n   whereof the Lord hath made him overseer: So shall the doctrine of truth be\n   preserved uncorrupt, many souls converted and built up, and himself receive\n   manifold comforts of his labours even in this life, and afterward the crown\n   of glory laid up for him in the world to come.\n\nWhere there are more ministers in a congregation than one, and they of\ndifferent gifts, each may more especially apply himself to doctrine or\nexhortation, according to the gift wherein he most excelleth, and as they\nshall agree between themselves.\n"},{"name":"Of Prayer after Sermon.","text":"\nThe sermon being ended, the minister is \"To give thanks for the great\nlove of God, in sending his Son Jesus Christ unto us; for the\ncommunication of his Holy Spirit; for the light and liberty of the\nglorious gospel, and the rich and heavenly blessings revealed therein;\nas, namely, election, vocation, adoption, justification, sanctification,\nand hope of glory; for the admirable goodness of God in freeing the land\nfrom antichristian darkness and tyranny, and for all other national\ndeliverances; for the reformation of religion; for the covenant; and for\nmany temporal blessings.\n\nTo pray for the continuance of the gospel, and all ordinances thereof, in\ntheir purity, power, and liberty: to turn the chief and most useful heads\nof the sermon into some few petitions; and to pray that it may abide in\nthe heart, and bring forth fruit.\n\nTo pray for preparation for death and judgment, and a watching for the\ncoming of our Lord Jesus Christ: to entreat of God the forgiveness of the\niniquities of our holy things, and the acceptation of our spiritual\nsacrifice, through the merit and mediation of our great High Priest and\nSaviour the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n\nAnd because the prayer which Christ taught his disciples is not only a\npattern of prayer, but itself a most comprehensive prayer, we recommend\nit also to be used in the prayers of the church. And whereas, at the\nadministration of the sacraments, the holding publick fasts and days of\nthanksgiving, and other special occasions, which may afford matter of\nspecial petitions and thanksgivings, it is requisite to express somewhat\nin our publick prayers, (as at this time it is our duty to pray for a\nblessing upon the Assembly of Divines, the armies by sea and land, for\nthe defence of the King, Parliament, and Kingdom,) every minister is\nherein to apply himself in his prayer, before or after sermon, to those\noccasions: but, for the manner, he is left to his liberty, as God shall\ndirect and enable him in piety and wisdom to discharge his duty.\n\nThe prayer ended, let a psalm be sung, if with conveniency it may be\ndone.

and the\nsanctifying virtue of the Spirit of Christ against the dominion of sin,\nand the corruption of our sinful nature: That baptizing, or sprinkling\nand washing with water, signifieth the cleansing from sin by the blood\nand for the merit of Christ, together with the mortification of sin, and\nrising from sin to newness of life, by virtue of the death and\nresurrection of Christ: That the promise is made to believers and their\nseed; and that the seed and posterity of the faithful, born within the\nchurch, have, by their birth, interest in the covenant, and right to the\nseal of it, and to the outward privileges of the church, under the\ngospel, no less than the children of Abraham in the time of the Old\nTestament; the covenant of grace, for substance, being the same; and the\ngrace of God, and the consolation of believers, more plentiful than\nbefore: That the Son of God admitted little children into his presence,\nembracing and blessing them, saying, *For of such is the kingdom of God:*\nThat children, by baptism, are solemnly received into the bosom of the\nvisible church, distinguished from the world, and them that are without,\nand united with believers; and that all who are baptized in the name of\nChrist, do renounce, and by their baptism are bound to fight against the\ndevil, the world, and the flesh: That they are Christians, and federally\nholy before baptism, and therefore are they baptized: That the inward\ngrace and virtue of baptism is not tied to that very moment of time\nwherein it is administered; and that the fruit and power thereof reacheth\nto the whole course of our life; and that outward baptism is not so\nnecessary, that, through the want thereof, the infant is in danger of\ndamnation, or the parents guilty, if they do not contemn or neglect the\nordinance of Christ, when and where it may be had.\"\n\nIn these or the like instructions, the minister is to use his own liberty\nand godly wisdom, as the ignorance or errors in the doctrine of baptism,\nand the edification of the people, shall require.\n\nHe is also to admonish all that are present,\n\n\"To look back to their baptism; to repent of their sins against their\ncovenant with God; to stir up their faith; to improve and make right use\nof their baptism, and of the covenant sealed thereby betwixt God and\ntheir souls.\"\n\nHe is to exhort the parent,\n\n\"To consider the great mercy of God to him and his child; to bring up the\nchild in the knowledge of the grounds of the Christian religion, \"and in\nthe nurture and admonition of the Lord; and to let him know the danger of\nGod's wrath to himself and child, if he be negligent: requiring his\nsolemn promise for the performance of his duty.\"\n\nThis being done, prayer is also to be joined with the word of\ninstitution, for sanctifying the water to this spiritual use;

make this baptism to the infant a seal of\nadoption, remission of sin, regeneration, and eternal life, and all other\npromises of the covenant of grace: That the child may be planted into the\nlikeness of the death and resurrection of Christ; and that, the body of\nsin being destroyed in him, he may serve God in newness of life all his\ndays.\"\n\nThen the minister is to demand the name of the child; which being told\nhim, he is to say, (calling the child by his name,)\n\n*I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\nHoly Ghost.*\n\nAs he pronounceth these words, he is to baptize the child with water: which,\nfor the manner of doing of it, is not only lawful but sufficient, and most\nexpedient to be, by pouring or sprinkling of the water on the face of the\nchild, without adding any other ceremony.\n\nThis done, he is to give thanks and pray, to this or the like purpose:\n\n\"Acknowledging with all thankfulness, that the Lord is true and faithful\nin keeping covenant and mercy: That he is good and gracious, not only in\nthat he numbereth us among his saints, but is pleased also to bestow upon\nour children this singular token and badge of his love in Christ: That,\nin his truth and special providence, he daily bringeth some into the\nbosom of his church, to be partakers of his inestimable benefits,\npurchased by the blood of his dear Son, for the continuance and increase\nof his church.\n\nAnd praying, That the Lord would still continue, and daily confirm more\nand more this his unspeakable favour: That he would receive the infant\nnow baptized, and solemnly entered into the household of faith, into his\nfatherly tuition and defence, and remember him with the favour that he\nsheweth to his people; that, if he shall be taken out of this life in his\ninfancy, the Lord, who is rich in mercy, would be pleased to receive him\nup into glory; and if he live, and attain the years of discretion, that\nthe Lord would so teach him by his word and Spirit, and make his baptism\neffectual to him, and so uphold him by his divine power and grace, that\nby faith he may prevail against the devil, the world, and the flesh, till\nin the end he obtain a full and final victory, and so be kept by the\npower of God through faith unto salvation, through Jesus Christ our\nLord.\"\n"},{"name":"Of the celebration of the communion, or sacrament of the Lord's supper.","text":"\nThe communion, or supper of the Lord, is frequently to be celebrated;

applying by\nfaith the promises and goodness of God for pardon, help, and deliverance\nfrom the evils felt, feared, or deserved; and for obtaining the blessings\nwhich we need and expect; together with a giving up of ourselves wholly\nand for ever unto the Lord.\"\n\nIn all these, the ministers, who are the mouths of the people unto God,\nought so to speak from their hearts, upon serious and thorough\npremeditation of them, that both themselves and their people may be much\naffected, and even melted thereby, especially with sorrow for their sins;\nthat it may be indeed a day of deep humiliation and afflicting of the\nsoul.\n\nSpecial choice is to be made of such scriptures to be read, and of such\ntests for preaching, as may best work the hearts of the hearers to the\nspecial business of the day, and most dispose them to humiliation and\nrepentance: insisting most on those particulars which each minister's\nobservation and experience tells him are most conducing to the\nedification and reformation of that congregation to which he preacheth.\n\nBefore the close of the publick duties, the minister is, in his own and\nthe people's name, to engage his and their hearts to be the Lord's, with\nprofessed purpose and resolution to reform whatever is amiss among them,\nand more particularly such sins as they have been more remarkably guilty\nof; and to draw near unto God, and to walk more closely and faithfully\nwith him in new obedience, than ever before.\n\nHe is also to admonish the people, with all importunity, that the work of\nthat day doth not end with the publick duties of it, but that they are so\nto improve the remainder of the day, and of their whole life, in\nreinforcing upon themselves and their families in private all those godly\naffections and resolutions which they professed in publick, as that they\nmay be settled in their hearts for ever, and themselves may more sensibly\nfind that God hath smelt a sweet savour in Christ from their\nperformances, and is pacified towards them, by answers of grace, in\npardoning of sin, in removing of judgments, in averting or preventing of\nplagues, and in conferring of blessings, suitable to the conditions and\nprayers of his people, by Jesus Christ.\n\nBesides solemn and general fasts enjoined by authority, we judge that, at\nother times, congregations may keep days of fasting, as divine providence\nshall administer unto them special occasion; and also that families may\ndo the same, so it be not on days wherein the congregation to which they\ndo belong is to meet for fasting, or other publick duties of worship.\n"},{"name":"Concerning the Observation of Days of Publick Thanksgiving.","text":"\nWhen any such day is to be kept, let notice be given of it, and of the\noccasion thereof, some convenient time before, that the people may the\nbetter prepare themselves thereunto.\n\nThe day being come, and the congregation (after private preparations)\nbeing assembled, the minister is to begin with a word of exhortation, to\nstir up the people to the duty for which they are met, and with a short\nprayer for God's assistance and blessing, (as at other conventions for\npublick worship,) according to the particular occasion of their meeting.\n\nLet him then make some pithy narration of the deliverance obtained, or\nmercy received, or of whatever hath occasioned that assembling of the\ncongregation, that all may better understand it, or be minded of it, and\nmore affected with it.\n\nAnd, because singing of psalms is of all other the most proper ordinance\nfor expressing of joy and thanksgiving, let some pertinent psalm or\npsalms be sung for that purpose, before or after the reading of some\nportion of the word suitable to the present business.\n\nThen let the minister, who is to preach, proceed to further exhortation and\nprayer before his sermon, with special reference to the present work: after\nwhich, let him preach upon some text of Scripture pertinent to the occasion.\n\nThe sermon ended, let him not only pray, as at other times after\npreaching is directed, with remembrance of the necessities of the Church,\nKing, and State, (if before the sermon they were omitted,) but enlarge\nhimself in due and solemn thanksgiving for former mercies and\ndeliverances; but more especially for that which at the present calls\nthem together to give thanks: with humble petition for the continuance\nand renewing of God's wonted mercies, as need shall be, and for\nsanctifying grace to make a right use thereof. And so, having sung\nanother psalm, suitable to the mercy, let him dismiss the congregation\nwith a blessing, that they may have some convenient time for their repast\nand refreshing.\n\nBut the minister (before their dismission) is solemnly to admonish them\nto beware of all excess and riot, tending to gluttony or drunkenness, and\nmuch more of these sins themselves, in their eating and refreshing; and\nto take care that their mirth and rejoicing be not carnal, but spiritual,\nwhich may make God's praise to be glorious, and themselves humble and\nsober; and that both their feeding and rejoicing may render them more\ncheerful and enlarged, further to celebrate his praises in the midst of\nthe congregation, when they return unto it in the remaining part of that\nday.\n\nWhen the congregation shall be again assembled, the like course in\npraying, reading, preaching, singing of psalms, and offering up of more\npraise and thanksgiving, that is before directed for the morning, is to\nbe renewed and continued, so far as the time will give leave.\n\nAt one or both of the publick meetings that day, a collection is to be\nmade for the poor, (and in the like manner upon the day of publick\nhumiliation,) that their loins may bless us, and rejoice the more with\nus. And the people are to be exhorted, at the end of the latter meeting,\nto spend the residue of that day in holy duties, and testifications of\nChristian love and charity one towards another, and of rejoicing more and\nmore in the Lord; as becometh those who make the joy of the Lord their\nstrength.\n"},{"name":"Of Singing of Psalms.","text":"\nIt is the duty of Christians to praise God publickly, by singing of\npsalms together in the congregation, and also privately in the family.\n\nIn singing of psalms, the voice is to be tunably and gravely ordered; but\nthe chief care must be to sing with understanding, and with grace in the\nheart, making melody unto the Lord.\n\nThat the whole congregation may join herein, every one that can read is\nto have a psalm book; and all others, not disabled by age or otherwise,\nare to be exhorted to learn to read. But for the present, where many in\nthe congregation cannot read, it is convenient that the minister, or some\nother fit person appointed by him and the other ruling officers, do read\nthe psalm, line by line, before the singing thereof.\n"},{"name":"AN APPENDIX, Touching Days and Places for Publick Worship.","text":"\nThere is no day commanded in scripture to be kept holy under the gospel\nbut the Lord's day, which is the Christian Sabbath.\n\nFestival days, vulgarly called *Holy-days,* having no warrant in the word\nof God, are not to be continued.\n\nNevertheless, it is lawful and necessary, upon special emergent\noccasions, to separate a day or days for publick fasting or thanksgiving,\nas the several eminent and extraordinary dispensations of God's\nprovidence shall administer cause and opportunity to his people.\n\nAs no place is capable of any holiness, under pretence of whatsoever\ndedication or consecration; so neither is it subject to such pollution by\nany superstition formerly used, and now laid aside, as may render it\nunlawful or inconvenient for Christians to meet together therein for the\npublick worship of God. And therefore we hold it requisite, that the\nplaces of publick assembling for worship among us should be continued and\nemployed to that use.\n"}]}
