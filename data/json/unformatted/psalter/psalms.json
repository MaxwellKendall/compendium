We have represented to us in it, (1.) The character of the godly; how holy they are, abstaining from every temptation to, or appearance of evil; and with pleasure meditating on, and endeavouring to fulfil the whole law of God, ver. 1-2; and how happy, planted in the nearest fellowship with Jesus, the River of Life, they prosper in their lawful attempts: They never fall from their grace or profession; and they shall stand with approbation at the judgment-seat of God, ver. 3. (2.) The sinfulness and misery of the wicked: How different from, and contrary to the godly in their inclinations, companions, exercises, and ends! How light and unsubstantial, as chaff, and ready to be hurled by the storms of infinite wrath, into the depths of hell, as cast and condemned in the righteous judgment of God! ver. 4-5. (3.) The great reason of the happiness of saints, and of the misery of sinners: The Lord loveth the righteous, and observes and approves of their inclinations and behaviour; but, as an enemy, he brings destructive vengeance upon the wicked, ver. 6.<br/>While I sing these important lines, let my soul lift up her eyes to that great pattern of perfection, Jesus, the man of God's right hand, who was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners; and who fulfilled all righteousness, magnified the law, and made it honourable for men ­ for me. United to his person, clothed with his righteousness, and all inflamed and animated with his redeeming love shed abroad in my heart, let me examine myself as in his sight; let me walk in him as my way, and follow him as my pattern and guide: Let me with solemn awe look to, and prepare for his last, his eternal judgment!\n"}},{"number":2,"suggested_tunes":["York","Westminster"],"metre":"C.M.","is_second_version":false,"text":"Why rage the heathen? and vain things\nwhy do the people mind?\nKings of the earth do set themselves,\nand princes are combined,\n\nTo plot against the LORD, and his\nAnointed, saying thus,\nLet us asunder break their bands,\nand cast their cords from us.\n\nHe that in heaven sits shall laugh;\nthe Lord shall scorn them all.\nThen shall he speak to them in wrath,\nin rage he vex them shall.\n\nYet, notwithstanding, I have him\nto be my King appointed;\nAnd over Zion, my holy hill,\nI have him King anointed.\n\nThe sure decree I will declare;\nthe LORD hath said to me,\nThou art mine only Son; this day\nI have begotten thee.\n\nAsk of me, and for heritage\nthe heathen I'll make thine;\nAnd, for possession, I to thee\nwill give earth's utmost line.\n\nThou shalt, as with a weighty rod\nof iron, break them all;\nAnd, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt\nthem dash in pieces small.\n\nNow, therefore, kings, be wise; be taught,\nye judges of the earth:\nServe GOD in fear, and see that ye\njoin trembling with your mirth.\n\nKiss ye the Son, lest in his ire\nye perish from the way,\nIf once his wrath begin to burn:\nbless'd all that on him stay.\n","commentary":{"john_brown":"Perhaps this psalm relates partly to David’s instalment on his throne, and the victories over his enemies which attended it.

The violent and harmonious, but unsuccessful opposition, which Jews and Gentiles of all ranks make to the person and redemption work of the great God my Saviour. Behold what ruin and woe they draw upon themselves by their attempts! ver. 1-5, 9. (2.) Behold how, notwithstanding all their raging malice and furious opposition, Jehovah instals our Redeemer King in his church, and infallibly fixeth him on his throne; avows him his only begotten Son, and gives unto him the Gentiles for his people! ver. 6-8. (3.) Behold Jehovah’s demand of serious consideration and fear of, joy in, and trust, obedience and love to his exalted Son, ver. 9-12. <br/><br/><br/>     While I sing, let me remark the horrid nature of sin; let me with broken heart, bewail my neglect of, and opposition to Jesus Christ.

He encourageth himself in his God, as the source and subject-matter of his safety, joy, and honour, ver. 3. (3.) He recollects, how, on former occasions, his troubles had driven him to his prayers; how he had always found God ready to hear and grant his requests; how safe and easy he had lived under his protection; and how effectually he had broken the power and restrained the malice of his enemies, ver 4-5, 7. ( 4.) Triumphantly trusting in God, as the salvation and blesser of his people, he silenceth all his fears, and pours forth his prayers for new protection and deliverance, ver. 6, 8. <br/><br/><br/> Think, my soul, of Jesus, who, when bulls of Bashan compassed him about, trusted in God, that he would deliver him.

Addressing himself to men, particularly to his persecutors, he reproves their contempt of God and religion, their delight in, and practice of vanity, fraud, and falsehood. He represents the happiness of the saints in having God their protector, and ready to hear their requests. He recommends a holy filial awe of God, and careful abstinence from sin; together with a devoting of themselves, and their conduct and substance, to the Lord, ver. 2-5. (3.)

As the Mosaic system, and the covenant between God and Israel, as his peculiar people, promised remarkable temporal felicity to such as were obedient to the law, and denounced temporal miseries against those that were impious and profane; so the psalmist here cautions against stumbling at particular providences, which might appear contrary to the tenour of that covenant. Here are, (1.) Plain and express warnings against fretfulness at the prosperity of the wicked, in their wickedness, ver. 1, 7-8; with the arguments and reasons enforcing the same, viz. that the character of the wicked is ignominious, while that of the righteous is honourable, ver. 12, 14, 21, 26, 30-32; that the wicked, in the very height of their prosperity, are near to destruction, while the righteous, even in their adversity, have special protection from God, and shall never be ruined, ver. 2, 9-10, 13, 15, 17, 20, 28, 33-40; and that God hath special blessings in store for, and even in this life manifests distinguished kindness to, the righteous and their seed, ver. 11, 16, 18-19, 22-25, 28-29, 37. (2.) Here are proper and effectual remedies to prevent sinful fretting at the prosperity of the wicked, or troubles of the godly, viz. hoping in God as our Saviour; delighting in God as our companion, friend and portion; following him as our guide; departing from evil and doing good; waiting on the Lord, and keeping his way, ver. 3-6, 27, 34.<br/><br/><br/>Be thou, my soul, an accurate observer, of the matter and circumstances of every providence.
